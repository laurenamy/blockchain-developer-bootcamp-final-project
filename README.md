# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Basic Description: 
- Event based token creation and distribution

What would this be used for?
- Exclusive access to commemorative items for
  - game releases
  - conference attendence
  - weddings??? 

Workflow
- Event organizers use the platform to create ERC721 tokens to represent their event, potentially more granular sub-events (a particular talk at a conference, or an after party event)
- Event attendees are given access to the pool of tokens and can claim their token with a key (??) determined by the organizers
- These tokens are similar to commemorative coins specific to anniversary events or the like
- Users can display their coins on a profile page

Questions
- How would attendees prove their attendence to claim tokens?


Second Iteration

1. User creates a Pool of tokens
  a. chooses the worth and finite number of tokens
2. User adds admins to Pool
3. User/admins send tokens to token recipients
