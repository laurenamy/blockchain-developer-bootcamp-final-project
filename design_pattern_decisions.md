# Design Patterns

## Role-based Access - Ownable, Admins

Implemented a "kill-switch" function that will stop most contract functionality but still allow users who donated to retrieve refunds.

Added admin functionality to process refunds.

## Inheritance - Counters, Safemath

Used existing Openzeppelin contracts to safely create ids for structs and calculations.
